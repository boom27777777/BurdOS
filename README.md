It's probably going to replace Win32

Hello, and welcome to the BurdOS repo. 

This is more of a project to learn about computing systems and how they function at a kernel level. 

I offer no warranty for this software, and you should run it at your own risk. Chances are your CPU will catch fire, your RAM will explode and your monitor will burn bad puns into your eyeballs.
